# Expense Reimbursement Process Optimization

## Objective
This project aims to optimize the employee **expense reimbursement** process by identifying bottlenecks, reducing cycle time, and enhancing automation using **SQL** and **Tableau**. The goal is to cut the average reimbursement duration from **~25 days to 7 days**, improving efficiency across employee, managerial, and finance touchpoints.

## Tools Used
- **PostgreSQL** (SQL analysis & insights)
- **Tableau** (Data visualization and dashboards)
- **Visio** (Process Mapping – As-Is & To-Be)
- **MS Word** (Documentation – Interviews, BRD, Insights)

---

## Process Followed

1. **Stakeholder Interviews**
   - Conducted 4 interviews from different companies to gather real pain points.
   - Key themes: Manual entry, long approval cycles, lack of tracking.

2. **Process Mapping**
   - Created **As-Is** and **To-Be** diagrams to visualize inefficiencies and propose automation steps.

3. **SQL Analysis**
   - Extracted stage-wise durations and department-wise delays.
   - Simulated “After” scenario by reducing key bottlenecks.

4. **Tableau Dashboards**
   - Built 5 dashboards comparing Before vs After:
     - Employee Submission Time
     - Manager Approval Duration
     - Accounting Review Time
     - Reimbursement Disbursement Delay
     - Total End-to-End Duration

5. **Business Requirements Document (BRD)**
   - Summarized scope, pain points, and user stories with clear acceptance criteria.
   - Proposed automation ideas like OCR, reminders, and real-time dashboards.

## Key Outcomes

- Reimbursement cycle reduced from **~25 days → 7 days**
- Employee submission time reduced by **~85%**
- Delays flagged via dashboard, improving managerial response time
- Proposed system improvements: OCR receipt scanning, pre-validation rules, smart dropdowns, and status dashboards

---

## Project Relevance

This is a **self-initiated project** designed to:
- Showcase stakeholder analysis
- Apply SQL & Tableau for process improvement
- Demonstrate real-world documentation via BRD
